## Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a Human Activity Recognition classification model that can infere the type of activity based on data from accelerometers.

Data was downloaded from the following url:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv


## Data description

You can also embed plots, for example:



```{r , cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
setwd("C://Users/Pablo/Dropbox/DataScience")
train<-read.csv("pml-training.csv")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
